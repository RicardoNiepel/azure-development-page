title: Software Development Fundamentals
description: List of recommendations for books and conferences on Software Engineering, Software Craftsmanship, DevOps and Software Architecture
---

The following lists my recommendations for getting a solid and practical software development foundation.  
It focuses on the four main topics (in my point of view):

1. Software Engineering beyond your basic education or studies
2. Software Craftsmanship
3. DevOps
4. Software Architecture

With "beyond your education or studies" I mean something after you have already taken your education or studies in
mathematical foundations, programming paradigms, languages and data structures. Some practical advices, something you can and should do every day at your software development work.

I have already read each of the following books and found them valuable.
The same applies to the conferences.

In my option software development fundamentals are in many cloud projects, thus I published this list.
