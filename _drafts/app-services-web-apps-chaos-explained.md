It never stops that I'm getting questions regarding
- Is Azure App Service different to Azure Web Apps?
- What is App Service for Linux?
- What is Web Apps for Linux?
- How is this different to App Service for Containers - or is it called Web Apps for Containers?
- How correlate App Service & App Service Plan & Web Apps & Slots together?
- Are they all sharing resources?
- At which level is vertical and horizontal scalaibilty applied?
- And now: how fits Azure Functions in this situation?
- Oh man: there is another question: What's the hell is a consumption plan?
- And this drives me crazy: My colleueges has spoken yesterday about Azure App Service for Windows?
and so on ...

So please let me use some grafics to explain all these things on one post as simple as possible to "knoten im Kopf l√∂sen".
And to make sure, I will never, ever get these questions or related ones again :)

# Azure App Service
aka Azure App Service for Windows, but only a few people are naming it like this.
The first version of Azure App Service was Windows based and no Linux version exists.
Thus we just skipped this detail in the past and also today (99,9%).
