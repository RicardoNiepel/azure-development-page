A long time ago I already had a blog but then I decided to focus on twitter and internal community stuff.

The world keeps turning and I notice more and more often, how the same questions come up with my different customers or in community conversations.

Thus I decided to start a new blog and focus on lessons learned, best practices and guidelines at my day to day job as a Cloud Solution Architect spezialized at Azure Application Development.

Regarding Azure Application Development, I will focus on
* Cloud Application Architectures & Design
* Microservices
* Serverless
or from a more product oriented view
* App Service
* Functions
* IoT Hub
* Service Fabric
* Application Insights
* Event Hubs
* Service Bus
* Event Grid
and we will see what's coming next.
