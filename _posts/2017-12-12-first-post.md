                }
            }
            catch (Exception)
            {

            try

                Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
                throw;
            }
            finally
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Get's not executed!!!");
            }
        }
    }
}

Use two trailing spaces  
on the right  
to create linebreak tags  

Finally, horizontal lines
